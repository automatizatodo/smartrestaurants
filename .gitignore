*.json # Broad rule, be careful if you have other non-sensitive JSON

*credentials*.json # Common naming pattern

# Firebase App Hosting (sensitive if it contains secrets, though typically used for config)
# apphosting.yaml # Better to keep this in repo if it only references secrets, not actual secrets.
# Commenting out apphosting.yaml from .gitignore for now, as it's configuration.
# If you ever put secrets directly in it (not recommended), then ignore it.
